# HelloHunter
HelloHunter is an open source OSINT platform created by Hello Security Research Labs

It is designed to add your API keys to the script, providing access to the OSINT services.
A user can currently look up a phone number, email address, social media accounts, and more.

This is built using the Python language and therefore (though yet to be tested on all platforms) should run in any python terminal.

Please dont forget to edit the script and add your API keys. 

As this is open source and minimalistic code, you should be able to add OSINT sources quite easily by editing the code.

As always, this is free to use and enjoy so long as the original creator, Hello Security is mentioned.


(HelloHunter is still a work in progress and is actively being developed - 
therefore there is bound to be a few glitches and bugs - please contribute any errors, 
traceback or otherwise in the errors tab here on github so we may streamline the code)
